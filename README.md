# cEDH-Regional-Meta
Breakdown of the Magic: The Gathering cEDH Regional meta using data from [TopDeck.gg](https://topdeck.gg/)

Visit [https://cedh-regional-meta.streamlit.app](https://cedh-regional-meta.streamlit.app/) to see the website!

Some Notes about use and future updates:

1. This can only use data that was avalible on TopDeck. This means we are only considering tournaments where the location data is availible and players from those tournaments that submited decklists

2. Currently this makes no consideration of who is using the deck, so in small regions with many small, registered tournaments one player can contribute to a large portion of the meta if they consistently attend tournaments. 

3. I plan on updates that will give more information about the data such as win loss draw of specific commanders.
